# CS315 - Data Structures and Algorithms
This class was exactly what it sounds like. We learned how to write and analyze algorithms and perform complextiy analyses to determine the [Big-O Time Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity) of those algorithms. We also learned how to create and use basic data structures such as, arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, graphs, etc. and the time complexities of navigating these data structures.

# In This Folder
All that is in this folder is a collection of programming assignments. These are all written in Java.

The first assignment was to implement two sorting algorithms (one elementary, one advanced) and run them on various sets of small and large data. Afterwards we were to perform a complexity analysis of these algorithms and determine their best, worst, and average case time complexities.

The second assignment was to implement the stack and queue data structures and use them to complete a simulation. Part of the code for the simulation had already been given to us, we had to use our stack and queue data structures where applicable to make the simulation functional.
