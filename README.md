# Small Projects and Assignments
A collection of school projects and assignments that I thought were cool, or would be easier to work on with version control, but not big enough to warrant their own repo.

Each folder in this repo corresponds to a class and/or project and will have a README within that folder describing the class and its projects and assignments (maybe).

# Why?
I made this repo mostly to show myself how far I have come from learning since learning Python in high school and barely being able to solve simple nested loop problems to where I am now, working on a research project programming a battery management system and how much I have learned and messed with along the way.

This project could also serve as an easy place to link friends and family to show them what I'm doing, what I've done and (hopefully) what I'm going to do. This repo has a good mix of projects and assignments that I'm relatively proud of others that I'm just amazed I got working well enough to demo and recieve a grade for.

# Some Things to Note
* As of writing this, these are all school projects and assignments from varying stages of my university career.
* The code style and documentation in some of these programs is horrendous, so I appologize in advance.
* I usually try to follow the Linux coding style as closely as possible, but that tends to fall apart when working with other people (especially when they don't know what a coding style is).
* This is mostly just small school projects and school assignments, check out my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/AVanDeBrook) for some other larger projects I've made from hackathons, research projects, and side projects.
