# CS225 - Computer Science II
This class taught some fundamentals of computer science and how to start designing software from an object-oriented perspective.

Basically, the purpose of this class was to learn how to write requirements and how to write software to meet and satisfy those requirements. This class also taught us to think through and design software, rather than just sitting down at a computer and starting to code.

Naturally, we used Java throughout this class to understand the fundamentals of object-oriented design. We used JavaFX to make GUIs.

* [`homework`](./homework)
A collection of the homeworks we did for this class, usually pretty simple problems that we had to solve using object-oriented approaches.
* [`project`](./project)
The final project for this course. We were allowed to pick our final project, the only requirements were that it had to include the following:
    * File I/O
    * Try-Catch Statemets
    * GUI
    * Inheritance (OOP)

## Project Details
I picked something called an "Elevator Study" for this project. Basically, it is a simulation of how a(n) elevator(s) would move through different sized buildings and how wait times would be affected for each floor of those buildings. I ended up having to study quite a bit of [Queueing Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory) to be able to make an even somewhat accurate simulation.

It was actually a very interesting project, hopefully some day when I have free time I can re-design the project and strip out some of the non-essential stuff (GUI, File I/O, etc.) to make it a more accurate simulation with more features. There is a detailed report (in the [ZIP file](./project/CS225_P07_AaronVanDeBrook.zip)) of what I learned along with what problems I encountered as well as some features that I thought could be added to make the simulation more accurate.
